# CUTGroup Structure and Roles

## Structure

The Miami-Dade CUTGroup will consist of the following:
- A **Director**, who will be a paid position which will report regularly to the advisors (See below) The deliverables will include:
  - A pool of Miami-Dade residents for resident testing, ensuring demographic and geographical diversity
  - Resident marketing and communication material distributed across the county to ensure the above
  - Proper technical groundwork for test subject sign-ups and notifications, with appropriate tech documentation for future implementations 
  - Gift cards for both test user sign-ups as well as research
  - Creation of general website outlying the project
  - Facilitation of multiple successful resident tests, both in-person and virtually
  - Appropriate Reporting and Communication to stakeholders for both individual research tests as well as overall reports for organizations interested in the group’s progress (such as Knight and Smart Chicago)

- An optional **Project Manager / Associate Director**, a paid part-time position which reports to the Director. Their job is to help organize a subset of the Directors duties as needed.

- Numerous **proctors** will be needed to conduct resident research studies at the facilities as needed. They will report to the Project Manager on site.

- Cristina and Rebekah (as well as Ernie, if he is not functioning as Director) will function as **advisors**. They will be non-paid positions that act as checks and balances toward the work of the Director, assisting directly or through resources as needed. The director may use advisors for delegation of duties as needed.

## Roles

- **Mangrove Labs LLC** will be the name of a Florida LLC, solely under Ernie Hsiung. The Miami-Dade County CUTGroup will be a project under Mangrove Labs, and may be used for other for-profit civic/data based projects in the future. That said, the organization has not been created yet pending review of stakeholders.

- **Code for Miami** is an all volunteer organization which applied to the Knight Cities Challenge Grant from the Knight Foundation. Some funding is given to us from Code for America for the purpose of hack night pizzas and events. As a long term goal, we’re thinking of moving Code for Miami under a non-profit, but it would be after the CUTGroup project is completed. The founders and captains of Code for Miami were the benefactors of the grant and we’ll use our membership as a possible pool for positions, both paid and voluntary.

- **Smart Chicago Collaborative** is a civic organization devoted to improving lives in Chicago through technology. We will be using their CUTGroup book as our primary methodology. We have made verbal agreements to use some grant funds to pay for SCC staff to travel down to Miami for training, and we will write necessary documentation and contribute to the CUTGroup collective and the open-source project. We will take advantage of Chicago’s CUTGroup numerous branding and best practices - their red “C” logo, for example — however, if the Director believes a variation of practice is needed for the purpose of most effectively catering to Miami-Dade residents, we’ll implement it, noting any change and effects.

- **Miami-Dade County** played a part in getting our Knight Foundation Grant. They were instrumental in stating they were contributing in-kind services through facilities (both at the Government Center as well as through many Public Libraries across Miami-Dade County. Due to Ernie’s 2015 Fellowship we have a relationship with their Communication’s team, and have a verbal agreement that the first tests will be related to MiamiDade.gov’s revamped website where they’ll be able to attend tests and iterate on feedback where necessary. 

    - Ernie will also reach out to various other departments within MDC to announce our availability for user testing, including their IT Department, and the Regulatory and Economic Resources Department.
    
    - While MDC are listed as partners, the Miami CUTGroup will manage the project and its mailing list. MDC is able to provide email addresses for possible respondents from a number of sources as a initial sample size, or as an initial user base to notify people about the CUTGroup.

- **The Miami Foundation** will (hopefully) be our fiscal sponsor. Note that the Miami Foundation requires that your project be incorporated as a separate legal entity under Florida law. As Code for Miami does not have a legal entity status and it takes less time to process an LLC than a 501(c)3, we will be creating Mangrove Labs as an LLC based in Florida, unless suggested otherwise.

- **Engage Miami**, **Miami-Dade CDC**, and **Catalyst Miami** sent recommendation letters to the Knight Foundation. We plan on reaching out for community building efforts.

- **The Knight Foundation** is the granter of the Knight Cities challenge. They will be giving any grant rewards to our fiscal agent, whichever we choose.
