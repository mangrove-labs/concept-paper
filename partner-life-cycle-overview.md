# Partner Testing Project life cycle overview

Taken from Sonja's slides at http://bit.ly/2f1mcaF

## Before

### Having the planning meeting

Goals: Understand criteria of what tech to test, do we have enough technology to engage with testers, and design a test to make the biggest impact of those residents

- [ ] Have a planning meeting to decide the partners needs and goals
  - Why would residents use this technology? 
  - What would they learn or do? 
  - What are they unable to do now that requires changes or improvements?
  - What stage is the technology in? (Concept? Alpha? Beta? Near launch?)
  - What experiences do you want to observe?
  - Is the site intended for everyday use? Or for specific tasks?
  - Chicago writes down three questions on post-it’s that you think we should ask testers at the screening phase
- [ ] Define the logistics (overall timeline, location and date)
  - decide the format (remote? in-person? one-on-one?)
  - decide who we want to include in the tests (build the screening questions)


### Building the Proctor guide, form, post-interview questionaire

- [ ] Write out the proctor Form
   - [Miami Template](http://bit.ly/2eJidAQ)
   - Build a form to be read and filled out by the proctor to a resident. 
   - Goal is to capture how a tester does a task or finds information. 
   - It’s also great to keep notes about the testers' experiences: “Tester thought that clicking on this would [do this] but it did [this instead]” or “Tester became frustrated that she could not find something on this page”

- [ ] Building the proctor guide
   - Similar to the planning meeting document, but specifically to give proctors a heads up on how to act so they're not confused.
   - Chicago Sample: http://bit.ly/2f2x5Zb
- [ ] Build the proctor questionaire
   - Miami Template is already created here: http://bit.ly/2ebxJVm

- [ ] Hold a training meeting with parters and proctors to go over everything
- [ ] Prepare tester packets
   - Includes tester sheets, name, address or phone number, designations, answers to the screening questions, consent form, envelope with gift card inside, proctor questionaire


### Send first round e-mails to recruit for testers, T MINUS 2 WEEKS

### Send second round e-mails to recruit for testers, T MINUS 1 WEEK

## During

### Before the test happens

 - [ ] Recruit for proctors


### Preparing for the test day 

- Do we have the $20 gift cards on hand?
  - If so, write down names and the gift card numbers before giving them their numbers
  - If not …?

## After

- [ ] Send gift cards, if you have not done so already
- [ ] Pay proctors, if you have not done so already

- [ ] Upload all photographs and videos of the session somewhere
- [ ] Anonymous test sources and post them online
- [ ] Create the Results Partner Presentation ([Example](http://bit.ly/2eJg0p4))
- [ ] Writing the report
  - Sample: http://www.slideshare.net/smartchicago/final-report-for-cutgroup-24-opengrid/1
  - Sample: http://www.slideshare.net/smartchicago/final-report-for-cutgroup-17-ventra-mobile-app
